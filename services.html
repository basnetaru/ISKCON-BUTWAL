          <h1 class="h1-services">FOUNDER</h1>
          <p class="p-services">
            In 1965, at the age of 70, His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
            Srila Prabhupada journeyed alone from India to America, to bring the
            teachings of Krishna west. On July 11, 1966, Srila Prabhupada
            officially registered the International Society for Krishna
            Consciousness (ISKCON) in New York City, and thus began the
            worldwide Hare Krishna movement. Know more about him HERE.

        <div class="container-services-flex-items">
          <h1 class="h1-services">PHILOSPHY</h1>
          <p class="p-services">
            Krishna devotees teach that people are not their material bodies,
            but are eternal spirit souls, and that all beings are interrelated
            through God, the source of all existence. God is known by many
            names, primarily by the name “Krishna” which means “the
            All-Attractive Supreme Person.” The goal of life is to develop love
            of God, realized through the practice of bhakti-yoga, or devotional
            service.

        <div class="container-services-flex-items">
          <h1 class="h1-services">PRATICES</h1>
          <p class="p-services">
            In addition to daily meditation by chanting the holy names, ISKCON
            members practice attending regular worship services, studying
            scriptures, sharing sanctified vegetarian meals, and fostering
            fellowship among other Krishna devotees. To focus the mind and
            senses on spiritual pursuits, practitioners follow strict
            vegetarianism and abstain from intoxication, gambling, and illicit
            sex.

        <div class="container-services-flex-items">
          <h1 class="h1-services">PARTICIPATION</h1>
          <p class="p-services">
            Participation is open to anyone, regardless of race, religion,
            gender, ethnicity, or any other factor. While some “Krishna
            devotees” live in temples and ashrams (monasteries) as monks and
            nuns, the vast majority of Hare Krishna devotees live and go to work
            in the general community, practicing Krishna consciousness in their
            homes and attending the temple on a regular basis.

          <h1 class="h1-services">LEADERSHIP</h1>
          <p class="p-services">
            Prior to his passing away in 1977, Srila Prabhupada established a
            Governing Body Commission (GBC) to oversee the international
            society’s activities. This ecclesiastic board consists of 35 senior
            Krishna devotees, both men and women, who work together as a body to
            guide the organization. Each ISKCON temple is individually
            incorporated and manages its affairs through local leadership.

        <div class="container-services-flex-items">
          <h1 class="h1-services">SOCIAL CONTRIBUTION</h1>
          <p class="p-services">
            ISKCON promotes social progress through teaching spiritual solutions
            to the myriad of problems we face today including war, poverty,
            environmental degredation, racial and sectarian strife, etc. ISKCON
            also operates the world’s largest vegetarian food relief program
            through its Annamrita projects. ISKCON affiliates also operate
            several hospitals and schools across the world.
