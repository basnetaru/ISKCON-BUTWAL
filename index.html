          INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY FOR KRISHNA CONSCIOUSNESS <br />
          Founder Acharya: His Divine Grace A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada
        </h1>
        <p class="p-iskcon">
          Popularly known as the Hare Krishna Movement, ISKCON is a worldwide
          confederation of more than 600 temples and centers, 110 vegetarian
          restaurants, and a wide variety of community projects. ISKCON belongs
          to the Gaudiya-Vaishnava sampradaya, or denomination, a monotheistic
          tradition within the broad Vedic, or Hindu culture.
          <br />
          Based on the Bhagavad-Gita, ISKCON traces its spiritual lineage
          directly to the speaker of this sacred book, Lord Krishna, who is
          revered as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The text teaches that
          the goal of life is to develop love of God, or Krishna, realized
          through the practice of bhakti-yoga, the science of devotional
          service. In the latter part of the 15th century, Sri Chaitanya
          Mahaprabhu revitalized the bhakti-yoga tradition by introducing an
          expansive spiritual movement that swept India. Central to this
          renaissance was the emphasis on chanting of Krishna’s name. Underlying
          this simple practice was a profound, rational, and intellectually
          comprehensive theology.
          <br />
          This nonsectarian, monotheistic movement’s mission is to advance the
          well being of society by promoting the spiritual science of Krishna
          consciousness.
